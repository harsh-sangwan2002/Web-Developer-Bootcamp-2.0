            <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from
                the
                red
                junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat
                and
                eggs;
                others are kept as pets <sup>[1]</sup> or for cockfighting.

                Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023,
                and
                an
                annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
                year.
                There
                are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

            <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
            <p>Terms for chickens include:

                Biddy: a chicken, or a newly hatched chicken[2][3]
                Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
                Chick: a young chicken[4]
                Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[5]
                Cock: a fertile adult male chicken[6][7]
                Cockerel: a young male chicken[8]
                Hen: an adult female chicken[9]
                Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[10] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
                immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[11]
                Rooster: a fertile adult male chicken, especially in North America. Originated in the 18th century,
                possibly
                as
                a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the word cock.[12][13][14]
                Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[15]
                Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the word chicken,[16] as in William
                Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their
                dam".[17]
                The
                usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[18] In older sources, and still
                often
                in
                trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[19]

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most
                breeds,
                and the wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
                allow
                them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20]
                Newly-hatched
                chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
                however
                grow
                much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a
                heritage chicken of the same age.[22]

                Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging
                flaps of
                skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males.
                Some
                breeds
                have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[23]

                Chickens are omnivores.[24] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
                animals
                as
                large as lizards, small snakes,[25] and young mice.[26] A chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on
                the
                breed.[27] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[28]

                Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual
                chickens
                dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and
                nest
                sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif
                Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[29][30] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws
                in
                conflicts.[31] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a
                young
                fox.[32]

                Crowing (with audio)
                A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other
                males,[33]
                and in
                response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to
                call
                their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the
                air
                or
                on the ground.[34]</p>
